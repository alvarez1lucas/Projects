This link directs you to Data Wars, a platform where I have undertaken numerous projects to practice Python programming, data analysis, data science, applied statistics, and machine learning. Each project consists of an average of approximately 15 exercises. The capstone projects showcased here represent the culmination of my most comprehensive work. Data Wars played a pivotal role in allowing me to apply the concepts I learned in data analyst and data science courses, with a primary focus on working with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
